About Aryan Mewada Studios

Aryan Mewada Studios is an independent software studio focused on building
lightweight, useful, and performance-friendly applications for Windows users.

Our first product, AnyVidWall, is a live wallpaper application that allows users
to set any video as their desktop wallpaper. It is specially optimized for
low-end PCs while still delivering smooth performance on high-end systems.

We believe good software should be simple, efficient, and accessible to everyone.
Our goal is to create tools that solve real problems without unnecessary complexity.

All our products are developed with care, transparency, and user experience
as the top priority.
